        as 17th Century Jews arrive in New Amsterdam, and traces their journey as
        they contend with racism and suspicion in a fledgling republic. Ever since
        the first Jews arrived in America, their efforts to embrace the new culture
        while simultaneously maintaining tradition has often found them frequently

        Overruled by his superiors in the Netherlands - who claimed that Jews could
        contribute to the growth of the newly founded colony as well as anyone else
        - Stuyvesant relented, and a new era was underway. Over the course of the
        next few centuries, the Jews would play prominent roles in such important
        phases of United States history as the Civil War and westward expansion. From
        politics to entertainment, the Jews would continue to display their unique
        talent for innovation and adaptation in a wide variety of arenas. Yet despite
        the fact that the separation of church and state would open up a wide world
        of opportunities for them, the American Jew continued to endure anti-Semitism
